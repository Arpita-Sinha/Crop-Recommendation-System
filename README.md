# 🧠 Major Project: Machine Learning Model for Classification

## 📘 Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a supervised machine learning pipeline for classification tasks using Python. The model is designed to train on user-uploaded CSV data within a Google Colab environment. It covers key stages of an ML workflow: data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and result visualization.

> This project was developed as part of a major academic internship, reflecting practical exposure to machine learning and real-world data modeling.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a classification model using a supervised ML algorithm.
- Evaluate performance using various metrics and visual tools.
- Ensure code reproducibility and usability in academic/learning settings.
- Enhance understanding of model behavior through graphical outputs.

## ⚙️ Features

- 📂 **Dataset Upload via Colab**  
  Allows CSV file uploads interactively through Google Colab.

- 🧹 **Data Preprocessing**  
  Includes null value handling, feature selection, and formatting.

- 📊 **Model Training & Evaluation**  
  Trains classification models (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest) with evaluation via:
  - Accuracy Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report

- 📈 **Data Visualization**  
  Visuals include feature distributions, correlation heatmaps, and performance graphs.
